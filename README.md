## 🌟 Vision & Motive

India’s cultural heritage faces the dual challenge of physical distance and environmental decay. Inspired by the [Smarak AR](https://smarak-ar.vercel.app/about) initiative, this platform brings the past back to life by:

1. **Connecting Users with Both Monuments AND Sacred Creatures**: Celebrating not only architectural marvels, but also the rich mythological beasts, divine vahanas, and celestial chimeras carved into stone (*Yali, Makara, Airavata, Garuda, Nandi, Sharaba, Mayura*).
2. **Dual-Mode AR Exploration**:
   - **Remote Mode**: Place 3D monuments and sacred beasts right onto your living room floor, classroom desk, or table with 360° rotation and scale gestures.
   - **On-Site Mode ("Physically Present")**: Stand in front of actual monuments with real camera feeds, compass radar bearing, and a **Time-Travel Cross-Fade Slider** to see fallen spires and ancient golden-era architecture reconstructed over modern stone relics.
3. **Mobile-First Experience**: Motion gyroscope look-around (`DeviceOrientation`), mobile sticky bottom navigation bar, haptic vibration feedback (`navigator.vibrate`), and instant QR code connectivity between desktop and phone.
